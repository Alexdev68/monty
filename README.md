# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
## Introduction
This is a project given to us by the Alx SE program. This project entails a deep dive into stacks, queues and monty language.

## Description
This project has tasked us with creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, which we have done for the most part. The program we have created is able to handle a small variety of opcodes. Some of which are: push, pop, pall, pint, swap, add and nop. The push just adds an element to the top of the stack and pop removes from the top of the stack. So, these are some of the opcodes our program can work with, there are others. Our program can also handle comments by the use of the (#) character. The Alx SE program exposed us to a new language in this project called Brainfuck. This project contains a directory that has two impentations of brainfuck language in printing out School followed by a new line and adding number gotten from input. This program of ours doesn't do all that we were tasked with, but it does most of it.
